# Uniqprimer

## Description

Uniqprimer designs specific primers of bacterial sequences. The goal of this tool is to accept a number of "include" FASTA files of diagnostic target genomes (draft or complete) and "exclude" files of non-target genomes, and output a list of PCR primers that will amplify target genomes but not non-target genomes.

Uniqprimer has been developped in Colorado State University by [Jan Leach Lab] (http://leachlab.agsci.colostate.edu/), and encapsulated in Galaxy by [IRRI (International Rice Reasearch Institute)](http://irri.org/) and South Green bioinformatics platform
