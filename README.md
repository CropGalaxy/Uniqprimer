# Uniqprimer

## Description

Uniqprimer designs specific primers of sequences. The goal of this tool is to accept a number of "include" FASTA files of diagnostic target genomes (draft or complete) and "exclude" files of non-target genomes, and output a list of PCR primers that will amplify target genomes but not non-target genomes.
